Hey There! Welcome to my Portfolio 
<p>You can see that, this is how your portfolio would look like.</p>
<p>Hi! I'm Harshul</p>
<p>Quiet people always know more than they seem. Although very normal, their inner world is by default fronted mysterious and therefore assumed weird. Never underestimate the social awareness and sense of reality in a quiet person; they are some of the most observant, absorbent persons of all.</p>
<p> Technologies I've worked on: Mobile Application Development, UI/UX Design, Networking, Debugging, Prototyping and Product Testing. <a href="link"> portfolio</a>.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
