Hi Divya, this is Harshul mai tumse mil kar ye sab batana chahta tha but that's not possible, yet I'm recording this msg for you which may or may not make any differences between us. But it could 

	First of all let's talk about you, 15th of june the day we met on Facebook, from that day till the day we stopped talking to each 
other tumne mujhe har baar support kiya, itne pyaar se samjhaya but mujhe koi fark hi nahi padta tha. Mujhe ab bhi yaad hai jab tumne mujhse 
bola tha ki tum bohot difficult situation se bahar aayi ho tumhe support aur care ki zaroorat hai tum andar se toot chuki ho aur dobara 
ye sab handle nahi kar paaogi that time I should have to understand your feelings but I haven't maine sirf tumhe hurt kiya hai har baar kyu 
maine nahi socha tumhare baare me kyu tumpe shaqq kiya ye jaante hue ki tum aisa kabhi nahi karogi I know divya all this I'm saying you probabl
y don't wanna listen cuz mai apni galtiyan bata raha hu jo mai har waqt karta hu but mujhe bhi to pata chale jo tumne saha hai.

 Tumhe yaad hai mai tumhe chhoti bachhi bolta tha kyuki tum me bachpana tha TBH I was wrong wo mai tha jo baccho ki tarah react karta tha jise 
kisi bhi chiz se koi farq nahi padta tha badappan to tumm me tha jo har baat ko bhool kar mujhse baat kiya karti thi tumhe hi mujhe manana padta tha, gussa mujhe aata tha to sehna tumhe padta tha matalb hadd hai yaar ab ye sab sochta hu to sharam aati hai apne character ke upar kabhi kabhi gusse me mann karta tha tumhe chhod du kyuki uss waqt mai tumhe nahi gusse ko priority deta tha.... Jitna hurt maine tumhe kiya hai divya uss hisaab se tumhe mujhe kab ka alag kar dena chahyiye tha but tumne wo bhi nahi kiya all because in a hope that mai aaunga aur sab sort karunga but tum jaanti thi isliye tumne wo ummeed bhi chhodd di..

But divya what I really want to ask is to give me another chance to prove myself. I'm not showing off my extra care and support ki tum mere paas wapas aa jaao aur naahi mai tumhe relationship ke liye force karunga kyuki I too know ki it's a difficult task to trust me again after all this. But divya agar hum kabhi mile, I promise ki you'll notice changes inside me. Agar maine tumhe jaane diya hota then I'll not be the one real men you wanted. Divya I know somewhere inside you're still waiting for me to fix everything I started and this time I'm not gonna repeat my past mistakes again and all I wanted to say is I need you.
