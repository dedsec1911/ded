_Eenie meenie miney mo I'm changed you think so..._
_It's not like that and how it goes..._
_Nah this time not my head, it's my nose..._
_I'm sorry I'm behaving like I'm a kid..._
_Baby, Apologies for what I did..._
_Believe me this is not the real me..._
_I'd like you to serve me a cup of tea..._
_I'm a hero, not afraid of warning!_
_With all my respect again a very Good Morning_


_What you are, _
_What you'll be,_
_You're just a test subject,_
_What your girl gonna expect,_
_When you try to be perfect,_
_Then why you get neglect?_

_When you've expectations, not big just a little,_
_The more you think, more you gonna make it brittle,_

_Whenever you notice your girl is in Anger,_
_That clearly means you're in Danger!_
_Trust me and don't be a Stranger,_
_Bring her something like a heat Exchanger!_

_Hey, I'm here to remind that you'll never know what's inside a girl's mind._
_Wait a minute, A girl needs time, just to test you again in the mean time _

_If you fall I will catch you,_
_If you cry I will hold you,_
_If I breathe I will love you,_

_You are always on my mind,_
_Filling my thoughts from day to night,_
_You are the sun of my mornings,_
_And the moon of my nights,_
_You are the stars shining on me,_
_I just kept watching sitting on that tree._

_Yeah, I tried calling..._
_But some how signal is dropping,_
_Don't you worry sweetheart, I'm not stopping,_
_That's why I texted you,_
_A very Good Morning_

#MySunshine

_Sometimes I think I'm done,_
_Then I saw the shining Sun,_
_Everyday is a new day, a  new beginning,_
_Birds on the trees starts singing,_
_My day is not worth, If I won't talk to you,_
_It's like I got only days left a few,_
_You're my greatest fear,_
_I don't wanna loose you my dear,_
_You're the most important person in my life,_
_I promise one day you sure will be my wife_

Good Morning Love

_The Sun shines when you smile,_
_I suddenly start looking at you for a while,_
_I fell in love, when I saw the picture in your profile,_
_Hold my hand and have no fear,_
_I'm always there for you my dear._
_Time is not so far when we woke up together,_
_Holding tight each other in a cold weather,_

_One thing I never get tired of,_
_Just to say everyday, Good morning my Love._

#Forever

_My love & soul belongs to you,_
_My world revolves around you,_
_My love is true only for you,_
_Forget the butterflies, I feel the whole zoo when I'm with you._

_When your lips touches mine,_
_I close my eyes & it feels like a divine._
_I don't know what happened next,_
_We woke up next morning, soo relaxed !!!_

_You're my Queen, I'm your king,_
_We somehow act like a Spring,_
_Whenever somebody try to break us apart,_
_We pull towards each other like as we are._

_Soon we'll be husband and wife,_
_Together we'll spend our whole life._
_And someday we'll have a baby,_
_It might a girl or a boy maybe._

_And I'm glad that I can say you are mine,_
_Because when I'm with you I feel extraordinary_

_And yes, I want to celebrate our Anniversary no matter,_
_9 months have passed, like nothing,_
_It's True Love sweetheart, just not a thing._

#You`n`Me


_I love you so very much,_
_Even though at times I do things that hurt._
_I try so hard to hope that you always see_
_How much you being in my life means to me._
_I am sorry yet again for causing you pain._
_That is the last thing I ever wanted to do._
_Even when I am trying to look out for you and do the right thing,_ 
_I mess up, I am sorry for that too._
_I hope that you still know how much I love and cherish you,_
_Like nothing else in my life gives me the thrill of being loved by you._
_So I hope that you listen and see it in my eyes, _
_This sincere apology that comes with tears from deep inside._


_I know babe sometimes it's hard for you,_
_So what I say  I swear is true._
_Your best friend told me not to make plan,_
_Just enjoy these sweet moments holding each other's hand._
_I see your face, I see your smile,_
_I see your love, and all the while._
_You're soft inside and a bit shy,_
_But why, You don't have to be like my type of guy._
_The moment we had yesterday, I hope the time could freeze,_
_I'm feeling the heat, like it was hundred degrees._
_I got the best kiss of my life,_
_You're doing it so perfectly like we're Husband and Wife._

Morning Baccha
